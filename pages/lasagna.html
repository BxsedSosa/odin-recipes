  <h3>You will need the following:</h3>
  <img class='img-lasagna' src="../imgs/ingredients.jpeg" alt="ingredients">
  <ul class="ul-ingredients">
    <li>Pasta sauce</li>
    <li>Lasagna pasta</li>
    <li>Mozzarella</li>
    <li>Yellow onion</li>
    <li>Tomatoe Sauce</li>
    <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Parsley</li>
    <li>Parmesan</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>Beef & sausage</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Ingredient Information</h4>
  <ul class="ingredient-info">
    <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
  </ul>
